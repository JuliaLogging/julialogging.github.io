### Making changes

To make changes to the page, clone the repo and run `make serve` from the repository root.
This will launch a local webserver at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) which
you can open in a browser. When you make changes to the source files the page is
automatically rebuilt and the browser automatically refreshed.
