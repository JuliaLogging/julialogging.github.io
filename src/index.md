# Welcome to JuliaLogging!

This is the landing page of the
[JuliaLogging GitHub organization](https://github.com/JuliaLogging/). JuliaLogging is an
umbrella organization for logging-related packages and repositories in the
[Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) ecosystem.

The aim of this document is to be a "one-stop-shop" for everything related to logging in
Julia. The document is structured as follows[^1]:

 - _**Tutorials**_ will teach you the basics of Julia's logging system.
 - _**How-to guides**_ will guide you through the steps involved in adressing common tasks
   and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of Julia's
   logging system.
 - _**Reference**_ contains technical reference of functions and APIs (e.g. the docstrings).
   Use this when looking up details.
 - _**Background and discussion**_ covers some higher level topics.

!!! note
    Please help improve this documentation -- if something confuses you, chances are you're
    not alone. It's easy to do as you read along: just click on the "Edit on GitHub" link
    at the top of each page, and then [edit the files directly in your browser]
    (https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).
    Your changes will be vetted by developers before becoming permanent, so don't
    worry about whether you might say something wrong.
